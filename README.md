# PIQA
This repository contains fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa models tested on the PIQA (Physical Interaction: Question Answering) dataset. The project focuses on how well these models handle questions about everyday physical interactions and compares their performance with human-level reasoning in commonsense tasks.
